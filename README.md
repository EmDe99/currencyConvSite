# Currency Conversion Website

An idea that came to me during my international exchange. A quick and easy way of finding current exchange rates.

## Overview

In this project, I created a full-stack application, designed to give the user current exchange rates for multiple different currencys and cryptos. I used Node.js deployed to Azure to create a back-end which handled calls to the APIs. The frontend was built using only standard HTML, CSS and JS. I will take my experiences from this project and apply them to more advanced future projects. I put more thought to the deployment and function of the website rather than its design. 
                                                                                     
### The goal

Users should be able to:

- Choose between several different currencys.
- Input their desired amount.
- See the amount they would get in the converted currency.
- Clearly see what country the currency is from.


### Built with

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- localStorage (Web API)
- Azure

### TODO

- Still need to add better responsiveness for use on smaller screens.
- Fix bugs related to the inputs.
- Update dropdowns to incorperate flag icons. 

### What I learned

- I learned how to build a web application from scratch using back-end technologies like Node.js and further improved my knowledge in JavaScript. 

- I learned how to use Node.js and deploy it to Azure.

- I learned how to set up a RESTful API and fetch data dynamically from it when changes occur on the website.

- I further enchanced my knowledge on how to read and parse data from a JSON file and store it locally for a set amount of time.

- Next step is to learn a framework (React, AngularJS etc).
