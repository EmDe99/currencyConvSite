## Overview

In this project, I created a full-stack application, designed to give the user current exchange rates for multiple different currencys and cryptos. I used Node.js deployed to Azure to create a back-end which handled calls to the APIs. The frontend was built using only standard HTML, CSS and JS. I will take my experiences from this project and apply them to more advanced future projects. I put more thought to the deployment and function to the website rather than its design. 
                                                                                     
### The goal

Users should be able to:

- Choose between several different currencys
- Input their desired amount
- See the amount they would get in the converted currency


### Built with

- JavaScript
- localStorage (Web API)
- Node.js
- Azure

### What I learned

- I learned how to build a web application from scratch using back-end technologies like Node.js and further improved my knowledge in JavaScript. 

- I learned how to design a RESTful API using Express and define routes and endpoints for the application.

- I further enchanced my knowledge on how to read and parse data from a JSON file and store it locally for a set amount of time.
